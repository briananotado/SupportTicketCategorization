### Context

In today's dynamic business landscape, organizations are increasingly recognizing the pivotal role customer feedback plays in shaping the trajectory of their products and services. The ability to swiftly and effectively respond to customer input not only fosters enhanced customer experiences but also serves as a catalyst for growth, prolonged customer engagement, and the nurturing of lifetime value relationships. As a dedicated Product Manager or Product Analyst, staying attuned to the voice of your customers is not just a best practice; it's a strategic imperative.

While your organization may be inundated with a wealth of customer-generated feedback and support tickets, your role entails much more than just processing these inputs. To make your efforts in managing customer experience and expectations truly impactful, you need a structured approach â€“ a method that allows you to discern the most pressing issues, set priorities, and allocate resources judiciously. One of the most effective strategies at your disposal is to harness the power of Support Ticket Categorization.

### Objective

Develop an advanced support ticket categorization system that accurately classifies incoming tickets, assigns relevant tags based on their content, implements mechanisms and generate the first response based on the sentiment for prioritizing tickets for prompt resolution.
